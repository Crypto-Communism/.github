# Welcome to Crypto Communism! 🚩

## Introduction 🌟
Welcome to the GitHub organization of Crypto Communism, where we harness blockchain technology to create projects aimed at restoring equality and socialism in the digital realm. Here, we're committed to developing fully on-chain games that promote these values.

## Our Project 🎮
Currently, we're focused on our flagship game, **Crypto Communism**, accessible at [cryptocommunism.org](http://cryptocommunism.org). This game uses blockchain to empower players and demonstrate the potential of a decentralized, equitable economic system.

## Repositories 📁
- [TON Smart Contracts](https://github.com/Crypto-Communism/ton): Contains the smart contracts that power the Crypto Communism game. Fully on-chain with transparent, open-source code that upholds our commitment to a decentralized community.

## Goals 🎯
Our goal is to develop games that are not only fun but also fully on-chain, promoting transparency and fairness. By making our games completely on-chain, we ensure that all game logic and transactions are verifiable and aligned with our mission of fostering a socialist environment within the blockchain space.
